The Smart Classroom system is designed to automatically control electrical appliances—mainly lights and fans—using sensors.
It reduces power wastage by detecting human presence, room temperature, and ambient lighting conditions using sensors like:

PIR Sensor – detects motion/occupancy

IR proximity sensor – detects entry/exit

LDR – detects daylight

Thermistor/LM35 – senses temperature

When a student enters the classroom, lights turn ON automatically. When the room is empty, the lights turn OFF.
Fan speed is automatically controlled depending on the room temperature.

This system offers:

Power savings

Automation (no manual switching)

Support for physically disabled individuals

Efficient management of energy usage in educational institutes

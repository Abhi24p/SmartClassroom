The Arduino code performs three main tasks:

a. Motion Detection (PIR Sensor)

Detects motion using a PIR sensor connected to pin 21.

When motion is detected:

LED (or light) turns ON.

Timestamp is recorded.

If no motion is detected for 30 seconds, the LED turns OFF.
  

b. Temperature Reading (LM35)

LM35 sensor connected to analog pin 14.

Analog value is converted into Celsius using:

temperature = (analogValue * 5.0 * 100.0) / 1024.0;


c. Temperature Control

If temperature crosses the threshold (e.g., 30°C):

Another appliance (fan) can be activated.

The code uses simple logic for automation:

Motion = Light ON

No motion = Light OFF

High temperature = Fan ON

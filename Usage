* When someone enters the classroom, PIR/IR sensors detect motion → lights turn ON automatically.

* If the room becomes empty for set time (e.g., 30s–1min) → lights turn OFF.

* Temperature sensor continuously monitors room temperature.

* Fan speed is regulated based on temperature.

This ensures:

* Minimum human interaction

* Efficient power consumption

* Improved comfort for students

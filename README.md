# SmartClassroom
The Smart Classroom system uses PIR, IR, LDR, and temperature sensors to detect occupancy, daylight, and room temperature. Lights switch ON when someone enters and OFF when the room is empty. Fan speed adjusts automatically. It saves energy, reduces manual effort, and improves comfort and accessibility.
